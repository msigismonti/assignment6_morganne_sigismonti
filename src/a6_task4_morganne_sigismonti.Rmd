**Figure 1** Water levels (ft above sea level) for Mono Lake from 1850 through 2017 with important historical points and critical water levels. Black points, indicate years that influenced water levels in Mono Lake. In 1941, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (DWP) began diverting water from Mono Lake’s tributary streams. In 1979, Mono Lake Committee (MLC) sued the DWP. In 1984, the MLC had won multiple cases against the DWC and water began flowing down the Mono Basin streams’ dry channels. In 1994, decision 1631 was made to keep Mono Lake at 6,392 feet above sea level and ordered DWP to restore streams and waterfowl habitat damaged from diversions. In 1998, two restoration orders, 98-05 and 98-07, were issued by the State Water Board, requiring DWP to implement a restoration plan for Mono Basin's streams and waterfowl habitat. In 2013, responsible parties joined the Mono Basin Stream Restoration Agreement. The green line (6,377 ft above sea level) indicates when land bridges emerge and allow predators to reach major bird nesting sites, the red line (6,360 ft above sea level) indicates when water would have a salinity of 120 g/L and cause a decrease in brine shrimp availability for Eared Grebes and California Gulls, and the black line (lake level of 6,360 ft) indicates when water would have a salinity above 150 g/L and cause acute impacts.
